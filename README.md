# Target Sniper
A simple Google Chrome extension to help automatically add out-of-stock items from Target.com to your cart immediately once they are back in stock. 

Uses a simple technique: it repeatedly reloads the product page and monitors for the "Add for pickup" button. When an item is back in stock, it will click the "Add for pickup" button, placing the item in your cart. It also plays a loud sound to get your attention. From there, it's up to you to follow through with the checkout process. This is a "help me click the buy button as quickly as possible" helper.

I made this as a fun project and as a way to snag one of the highly coveted game consoles released this year. It worked for my purposes, but I would highly expect this to stop working once the Target website inevitably changes.
